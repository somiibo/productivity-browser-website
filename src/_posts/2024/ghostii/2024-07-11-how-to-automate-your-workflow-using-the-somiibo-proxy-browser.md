Next up, it's time to configure your user agents. Why, you ask? Different user agents help you mimic various devices, making your browsing sessions appear more natural.

To get started with automation, navigate to the 'Automation' tab. Browse through the available modules and select the ones that best suit your needs. Download and install them directly from the browser. Once installed, configure each module according to your requirements. This might involve setting up schedules, inputting data points, or even integrating with other productivity tools you already use.

And voila! Your Somiibo Proxy Browser is now a well-oiled machine, ready to take on the world. Remember to periodically check for updates to both the browser and the modules you've installed. Staying up-to-date ensures you're always running at peak efficiency.

Setting up your Somiibo Proxy Browser might seem like a daunting task at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it. Happy automating!
