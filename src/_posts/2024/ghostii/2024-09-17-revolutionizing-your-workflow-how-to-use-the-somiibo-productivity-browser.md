This can be particularly useful for testing how your content appears across various platforms or simply bypassing pesky restrictions that might be in place.

Setting up these advanced features in Somiibo is a breeze. Just head over to the settings, and you'll find options to assign proxies and user agents to individual tabs. It's as simple as selecting from a dropdown menu and hitting save. And voila! You're all set to automate your workflow like a pro.
