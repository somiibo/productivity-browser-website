Once upon a time, in the not-so-distant past, a browser was merely a window to the vast expanse of the internet. You'd click, wait (and maybe drum your fingers a bit), and voila! The world was at your fingertips. But, as the digital landscape evolved, so did our expectations. Fast forward to today, and the humble browser is no longer just a virtual tour guide. It's transformed into a powerhouse of productivity, streamlining our online experiences like never before. Enter the era of productivity browsers.

Now, you might be wondering, "What makes a browser productive?" Well, let's say it's akin to swapping your old bicycle for a shiny new electric car.
